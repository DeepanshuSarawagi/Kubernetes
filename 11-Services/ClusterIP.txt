- ClusterIP service helps to communicate the pods in different tiers.
- For example, pods in database tiers would want to communicate with pods in app tier, and this is where ClusterIP
  service comes in.
- ClusterIP service helps to group the pods together and provides a single interface to access the pods in a group.
- For example, a service created for the app-tier pods will help group all the pods together and would provide a single interface
  for other pods/services to access this.
- The requests are forwarded to one of the pods under the service randomly.
