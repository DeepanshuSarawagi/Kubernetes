# This document will cover basic overview of Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes Worker Node:
 - A node is a machine where Kubernetes is installed. It is where containers will be launched.

Cluster:
 - A cluster is a group of nodes.

Kubernetes Master:
 - Another node with Kubernetes installed in it, and it is configured as mastered.
 - The master watches over the nodes in the cluster and is responsible for actual orchestration of container on the
   worker nodes.

Components:
 - API Server
   - The API server acts as front end for Kubernetes.
   - The users, management devices, CLIs all talk to the API server to interact with Cluster.

 - etcd service
   - Etcd is a distributed reliable key value store used by Kubernetes to store all data used to manage cluster.
   - Etcd stores all the information of masters and nodes in the cluster in a distributed manner.
   - Etcd is responsible for implementing locks within the cluster to ensure that there are no conflicts within the master.

 - kubelet
 - Container Runtime
 - Controller
   - The Controllers are brain behind the orchestration.
   - They are responsible for noticing and responding when nodes, containers or endpoints goes down.

 - Scheduler
   - The Scheduler is responsible for distributing work on containers across multiple nodes.
   - It looks for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes.
