# This is a brief document to understand about concept of Pods in Kubernetes

- Kubernetes does not deploy containers directly on the worker nodes.
- The Kubernetes are encapsulated into Kubernetes object known as Pods.
- A Pod is a single instance of an application
- A Pod is the smallest object you can create in Kubernetes.
- Pods usually have one-to-one relation with your containers running your application.
- You do not add additional containers to your existing pod to scale application.
